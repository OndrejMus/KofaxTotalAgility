# Setup for new project
## Setup in KTA
- Create category
- Set your working category

## Task definition
- Gather document for training and testing
- Finalize and confirm requirements
- Confirm expected peaks in processing
- Confirm expected speed of processing and SLAs

## Solution design
- Draft or visualize solution (for example in www.miro.com)
- Confirm inputs, outputs and outcomes of manual activities
  - Input - what comes to activity from process
  - Output - what comes out of activity to process
  - Outcomes - what activity changes, for example
    - Database queries outside of select
    - API calls that change something
    - Webservice calls

## Things to consider
- Speed/throughput - can it handle peaks, accumulated workload afted holidays?
- Scalability - will it work if additional app/web/trans servers will be added to solution?
- Maintainability
- Exception handling
- Ergonomy
- Testability
